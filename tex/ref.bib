                   Our formalisation of type theory avoids referring to
                   preterms or a typability relation but defines
                   directly well typed objects by an inductive
                   definition. We use the elimination principle to
                   define the set-theoretic and logical predicate
                   interpretation. The work has been formalized using
                   the Agda system extended with QITs using postulates.},

                   inductive types in two ways: a QIIT can have more
                   than one sort and the later sorts can be indexed over
                   the previous ones. In addition, equality constructors
                   are also allowed. We work in a setting with
                   uniqueness of identity proofs, hence we use the term
                   QIIT instead of higher inductive-inductive type. An
                   example of a QIIT is the well-typed (intrinsic)
                   syntax of type theory quotiented by conversion. In
                   this paper first we specify finitary QIITs using a
                   domain-specific type theory which we call the theory
                   of signatures. The syntax of the theory of signatures
                   is given by a QIIT as well. Then, using this syntax
                   we show that all specified QIITs exist and they have
                   a dependent elimination principle. We also show that
                   algebras of a signature form a category with families
                   (CwF) and use the internal language of this CwF to
                   show that dependent elimination is equivalent to
                   initiality.},

                   in intuitionistic type theory. It extends
                   (generalized) inductive definitions and allows us to
                   define all standard sets of Martin-L{\"o}f type
                   theory as well as a large collection of commonly
                   occurring inductive data structures. It also includes
                   a variety of universes which are constructive
                   analogues of inaccessibles and other large cardinals
                   below the first Mahlo cardinal. In this article we
                   give a new compact formalization of
                   inductive--recursive definitions by modeling them as
                   initial algebras in slice categories. We give generic
                   formation, introduction, elimination, and equality
                   rules generalizing the usual rules of type theory.
                   Moreover, we prove that the elimination and equality
                   rules are equivalent to the principle of the
                   existence of initial algebras for certain
                   endofunctors. We also show the equivalence of the
                   current formulation with the formulation of
                   induction--recursion as a reflection principle given
                   in Dybjer and Setzer (Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci.
                   2183 (2001) 93). Finally, we discuss two
                   type-theoretic analogues of Mahlo cardinals in set
                   theory: an external Mahlo universe which is defined
                   by induction--recursion and captured by our
                   formalization, and an internal Mahlo universe, which
                   goes beyond induction--recursion. We show that the
                   external Mahlo universe, and therefore also the
                   theory of inductive--recursive definitions, have
                   proof-theoretical strength of at least Rathjen's
                   theory KPM.},

                   assistants such as Agda and Coq rely on computation
                   to automatically simplify expressions during type
                   checking. To overcome the lack of certain programming
                   primitives or logical principles in those systems, it
                   is common to appeal to axioms to postulate their
                   existence. However, one can only postulate the bare
                   existence of an axiom, not its computational
                   behaviour. Instead, users are forced to postulate
                   equality proofs and appeal to them explicitly to
                   simplify expressions, making axioms dramatically more
                   complicated to work with than built-in primitives. On
                   the other hand, the equality reflection rule from
                   extensional type theory solves these problems by
                   collapsing computation and equality, at the cost of
                   having no practical type checking algorithm. This
                   paper introduces Rewriting Type Theory (RTT), a type
                   theory where it is possible to add computational
                   assumptions in the form of rewrite rules. Rewrite
                   rules go beyond the computational capabilities of
                   intensional type theory, but in contrast to
                   extensional type theory, they are applied
                   automatically so type checking does not require input
                   from the user. To ensure type soundness of RTT---as
                   well as effective type checking---we provide a
                   framework where confluence of user-defined rewrite
                   rules can be checked modularly and automatically, and
                   where adding new rewrite rules is guaranteed to
                   preserve subject reduction. The properties of RTT
                   have been formally verified using the MetaCoq
                   framework and an implementation of rewrite rules is
                   already available in the Agda proof assistant.},
