\begin{abstract}
  Type theory can be formally defined in a type theory as a quotient inductive-inductive type (QIIT for short), but terms are littered with explicit transports along equality constructors, typically omitted and retouched in presentation, in proofs or even in the definition of type theory.
  In this paper, we argue that QIITs are sufficient but infeasible to define type theories in practice and propose to use quotient inductive-inductive-recursive types (\emph{QIIRT}s for short) and definitions by overlapping patterns altogether, to reduce the use of transports.
  As a case study, we investigate (parallel) substitution calculus and type theory with Coquand universes and $\Pi$-types as QIIRTs and prove meta-theoretic properties and compare our definitions with typical definitions using QIITs.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Points to elaborate:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item QIITs are littered with transports, causing too much pains while formalising a type theory.
  \item Rewrite rules are popular to make structural rules definitional but requires efforts to justify meta-theoretic properties in general.
  \item Further, the confluence check adopted by \Agda is based on complete development and requires one-step parallel reductions to have a confluent term, making a definition more complicated than necessary.
  \item Moreover, the use of rewrite rules is typically \emph{not} presented and discussed in literature. We are ignoring the elephant in the room.
  \item Instead, definitions by overlapping patterns (in theory) requires strong normalisation and local confluence, making definitions simpler to design.
  \item The rules for type substitutions are \emph{structural} shared with other type theories based on parallel substitution (in particular cwf).
  
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph*{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Exploring the potential use of quotient inductive-inductive-recursive types and definitions by overlapping patterns.
    In particular, we give
    \begin{itemize}
      \item a definition of parallel substitution calculus in type theory, whose type substitution rules are definitional and confluent, using quotient inductive-inductive-recursive types and definitions by overlapping patterns;
      \item a definition of type theory with Coquand universes and $\Pi$-types in type theory, extending the above substitution calculus.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Comparison with other definitions using quotient inductive-inductive types.
\end{itemize}
