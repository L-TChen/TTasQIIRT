                   with dependent types in Type Theory using a special
                   case of higher inductive types from Homotopy Type
                   Theory which we call quotient inductive types (QITs).
                   Our formalisation of type theory avoids referring to
                   preterms or a typability relation but defines
                   directly well typed objects by an inductive
                   definition. We use the elimination principle to
                   define the set-theoretic and logical predicate
                   interpretation. The work has been formalized using
                   the Agda system extended with QITs using postulates.},

  abstract =      {The metatheory of dependent types has seen a lot of
                   progress in recent years. In particular, the
                   development of categorical gluing finally lets us
                   work with semantic presentations of type theory (such
                   as categories with families) to establish fundamental
                   properties of type theory such as canonicity and
                   normalisation. However, proofs by gluing have yet to
                   reach the stage of computer formalisation: formal
                   proofs for the metatheory of dependent types are
                   still stuck in the age of tedious syntactic proofs.
                   The main reason for this is that semantic
                   presentations of type theory are defined using
                   sophisticated indexed inductive types, which are
                   especially prone to ``transport hell''. In this
                   paper, we introduce a new technique to work with CwFs
                   in intensional type theory without getting stuck in
                   transport hell. More specifically, we construct an
                   alternative presentation of the initial CwF which
                   encodes the substitutions as metatheoretical
                   functions. This has the effect of strictifying all
                   the equations that are involved in the substitution
                   calculus, which greatly reduces the need for
                   transports. As an application, we use our strictified
                   initial CwF to give a short and elegant proof of
                   canonicity for a type theory with dependent products
                   and booleans with large elimination. The resulting
                   proof is fully formalised in Agda.},
