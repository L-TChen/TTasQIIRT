                   allow the definition of datatypes which have
                   constructors for equalities over the defined type.
                   HITs generalise quotient types, and allow to define
                   types with non-trivial higher equality types, such as
                   spheres, suspensions and the torus. However, there
                   are also interesting uses of HITs to define types
                   satisfying uniqueness of equality proofs, such as the
                   Cauchy reals, the partiality monad, and the
                   well-typed syntax of type theory. In each of these
                   examples we define several types that depend on each
                   other mutually, i.e. they are inductive-inductive
                   definitions. We call those HITs quotient
                   inductive-inductive types (QIITs). Although there has
                   been recent progress on a general theory of HITs,
                   there is not yet a theoretical foundation for the
                   combination of equality constructors and
                   induction-induction, despite many interesting
                   applications. In the present paper we present a first
                   step towards a semantic definition of QIITs. In
                   particular, we give an initial-algebra semantics. We
                   further derive a section induction principle, stating
                   that every algebra morphism into the algebra in
                   question has a section, which is close to the
                   intuitively expected elimination rules.},

                   inductive types in two ways: a QIIT can have more
                   than one sort and the later sorts can be indexed over
                   the previous ones. In addition, equality constructors
                   are also allowed. We work in a setting with
                   uniqueness of identity proofs, hence we use the term
                   QIIT instead of higher inductive-inductive type. An
                   example of a QIIT is the well-typed (intrinsic)

                   is given by a QIIT as well. Then, using this syntax
                   we show that all specified QIITs exist and they have

  abstract =      {The metatheory of dependent types has seen a lot of
                   progress in recent years. In particular, the
                   development of categorical gluing finally lets us
                   work with semantic presentations of type theory (such
                   as categories with families) to establish fundamental
                   properties of type theory such as canonicity and
                   normalisation. However, proofs by gluing have yet to
                   reach the stage of computer formalisation: formal
                   proofs for the metatheory of dependent types are
                   still stuck in the age of tedious syntactic proofs.
                   The main reason for this is that semantic
                   presentations of type theory are defined using
                   sophisticated indexed inductive types, which are
                   especially prone to ``transport hell''. In this
                   paper, we introduce a new technique to work with CwFs
                   in intensional type theory without getting stuck in
                   transport hell. More specifically, we construct an
                   alternative presentation of the initial CwF which
                   encodes the substitutions as metatheoretical
                   functions. This has the effect of strictifying all
                   the equations that are involved in the substitution
                   calculus, which greatly reduces the need for
                   transports. As an application, we use our strictified
                   initial CwF to give a short and elegant proof of
                   canonicity for a type theory with dependent products
                   and booleans with large elimination. The resulting
                   proof is fully formalised in Agda.},

  abstract =      {We present a new coherence theorem for comprehension
                   categories, providing strict models of dependent type
                   theory with all standard constructors, including
                   dependent products, dependent sums, identity types,
                   and other inductive types.Precisely, we take as input
                   a ``weak model'': a comprehension category, equipped
                   with structure corresponding to the desired logical
                   constructions. We assume throughout that the base
                   category is close to locally Cartesian closed:
                   specifically, that products and certain exponentials
                   exist. Beyond this, we require only that the logical
                   structure should be weakly stable---a pure existence
                   statement, not involving any specific choice of
                   structure, weaker than standard categorical
                   Beck--Chevalley conditions, and holding in the now
                   standard homotopy-theoretic models of type
                   theory.Given such a comprehension category, we
                   construct an equivalent split one whose logical
                   structure is strictly stable under reindexing. This
                   yields an interpretation of type theory with the
                   chosen constructors.The model is adapted from
                   Voevodsky's use of universes for coherence, and at
                   the level of fibrations is a classical construction
                   of Giraud. It may be viewed in terms of local
                   universes or delayed substitutions.},
